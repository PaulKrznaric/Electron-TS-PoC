# Electron + TypeScript Proof of Concept

Using the [https://www.twilio.com/blog/an-introduction-to-building-desktop-applications-with-electron](https://www.twilio.com/blog/an-introduction-to-building-desktop-applications-with-electron) Electron get started document combined with [this article by Dave Bush](https://davembush.medium.com/typescript-and-electron-the-right-way-141c2e15e4e1) I'm attempting to get Electron working on MacOS with TypeScript and play around with it.

This is a repo for my own education, however, there should be a base here of TypeScript + Electron already setup and ready to run. 

## How to Run
Clone the repo and in the directory run the following commands:
`npm init -y`
`npm preinstall`
`npm start`

## Next Steps
I'd like to test what degree of functionality I can offload onto the user system inside of Electronp
